SLOC	Directory	SLOC-by-Language (Sorted)
225     top_dir         asm=225


Totals grouped by language (dominant language first):
asm:            225 (100.00%)




Total Physical Source Lines of Code (SLOC)                = 225
Development Effort Estimate, Person-Years (Person-Months) = 0.04 (0.50)
 (Basic COCOMO model, Person-Months = 2.4 * (KSLOC**1.05))
Schedule Estimate, Years (Months)                         = 0.16 (1.92)
 (Basic COCOMO model, Months = 2.5 * (person-months**0.38))
Estimated Average Number of Developers (Effort/Schedule)  = 0.26
Total Estimated Cost to Develop                           = $ 5,642
 (average salary = $56,286/year, overhead = 2.40).
